# Sci-fi Demo


### Why?

I finally decided to take the Unity 3d course authorized by Unity itself. This project is the result of this new knowledge. 
The course is not only "copy and paste", but it explains in depth the tools of Unity. It certainly comes out of this experience prepared to solve any problem.
